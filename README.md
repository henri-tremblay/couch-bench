couch-bench
===========

Reproduction of the [NodeJS vs J2EE benchmark]{http://java.dzone.com/articles/performance-comparison-between} used
as a demonstration in the following [article]{http://blog.octo.com/lart-du-benchmark/}.

The setup uses two machines, an injector and a server. I will provide a Vagrant file for them in the `vm` directory when I have time.

As of now, you can just deploy the server on a tomcat and launch the injector. That should do the trick.

I will provide more details ASAP.
